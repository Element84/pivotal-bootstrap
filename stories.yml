# Stories to import into Pivotal Tracker using the pivotal_boostrap script
#
#
# Format details:
#
# The top level is a key for a group of stories.  Grouping like this allows
# you to selectively load only the groups that apply to a project.
# Use the --groups option to specify the groups to include, --all to load all
# groups, or specify neither to be prompted for each group.  The "applies_to"
# field of each group specifies the prompt to use.
#
# Each group should have a "labels" key, which contains all of the labels used
# by that group.  Under each label, there are lists of chore, feature, and
# release stories with that label.  A story type may be ommitted if it's not
# applicable
#
# A story is typically just a string, specifying the name of the story.  If
# you need to add a description or other fill out other story fields, you may
# specify a hash instead.  Example:
#
#     features:
#       - This is a simple feature with just a name
#       - name: This one is more complex
#         description: |-
#           It specifies a description, which can take up
#           multiple lines.
#       - Another simple feature
#
